Extensible library for handling the XMPP protocol (RFC 3920). This
code is inspired by, but not derived from,
https://github.com/mattn/go-xmpp/.

The core of the protocol is handled by xmpp.go, structs.go, and
stream.go. Everything else is an extension, though some of the
provided "extensions" are mandatory pieces of the protocol.
